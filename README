Well, once upon a time.. I had 60kb text file full of links.
I wanted to download all, but you know, Canadian providers so greedy
So I have to be very carefull and then I decided to estimate download size.
I was too lazy for searching tool for that, so I made my own script.
Then I wanted to try github, it rules, I know.

Short story: I want save my  usefull script somewhere. And share.

sizer.py: Counts total size of in plain text file with list of links.
